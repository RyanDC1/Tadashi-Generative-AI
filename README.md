TADASHI is a generative AI chat application that uses Google's Deepmind Gemini API to generate responses. Tadashi can respond to user prompts, solve logical problems with reasoning, perform basic tasks and has a knowledge base of multiple languages that can be used for translation.<br/>
It also has the capability to summarize content either in general or summarize the contents of a website by providing a prompt with the desired URL.

# AIM
To Study and understand Generative AI and Large Language Models.

# Introduction
Generative AI refers to any AI system that can generate content such as text, images, and code. Generative AI and Large Language models are a subset deep learning models.

## Large Language Models (LLM)
Large Language Models, as the  term suggests is a language model that is trained on a large set of text/language data (petabytes worth). This data will include categories and patterns that define it such as language, sentiment. This will help the LLM understand these patterns during training. 

These models are trained in <b>general</b> to decode text based data and can be <b>fine tuned</b> for specific implementations.

One such LLM that I have used is the BERT model for question answering based on transformers, which you can find here: [React-QnA-NLP-Module](https://github.com/RyanDC1/React-QnA-NLP-Module)

<u><b>General Purpose ( Pre-trained models )</b></u><br/>
Models are trained to solve common language tasks such as:
1. <b>Text Classification:</b> Ability to categorize parts of text which can be later used for applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection etc. This is done by co-relating patterns that are detected with the pre-trained dataset.
2. <b>Question Answering:</b> Given a context (text data), ability to find the most probable answer within the context based on a question.
3. <b>Document Summarization:</b> Create a brief description of a larger text while retaining semantics.
4. <b>Text Generation:</b> Creating content from a given context.

_While General purpose models solve a lot of language tasks, they cannot directly be used for a specific application as the context and data set is large and may often produce an undesired response. This is where fine tuned models come into play._

<u><b>Fine Tuning</b></u><br/>
Let's say in addition to the basic language tasks we want our application to do additional tasks or refer to a subset of data such as medical data. Large language models need a specific context or training on top of the pre-trained models in order to be used for specific applications. The idea of creating application specific LLM's from scratch is resource intensive, hence using Pre-trained models as a backbone is more efficient.

_A good example is as explained by John Ewald in [Introduction to LLM](https://youtu.be/zizonToFXDs?t=58). The example states that we can train a dog to follow basic commands such as 'Sit', 'Follow' and 'Stay', however if we need a special-service dog such as a guide dog or a police dog, we need to add "special trainings" to the basic training._

Special trainings allow the LLM to be fine tuned to a specific application without having to re-train the basic tasks such as text classification (a form of Transfer learning).

Special training can be a set of language data based on which the LLM must be trained.

_for example if we want to build a customer support bot for a car company, the training dataset would include all the data about the company, their products and their services. The new model can now perform the same basic tasks, but with the context of the companies data in addition to the original dataset._

## Generative AI
While LLM's are specifically designed to generate and process text based content, Generative AI are designed to be <b>multi modal</b>, i.e. they can take text or an image as input and produce text, images, code, music or video as content. This makes LLM a subset of Generative AI.

Generative AI models are designed to use neural networks to learn from large datasets of text, images, code, audio, video and even music. By discerning patterns within this data, these models are capable of producing novel content that mirrors the characteristics of the learned data.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs consist of two components or neural networks:
1. Generator
2. Discriminator

![GAN Flowchart](/assets/GAN_Flowchart.png)

The generators job is to create a new output based on previously learned patterns that resemble the real data.
The discriminators job is to take the real data from the actual dataset and fake data generated by the generator, and try to classify which data is real and fake.

The Goal of the generator is to produce an output that deceives the discriminator into thinking the data is real. If the discriminator cannot tell the real data apart from the fake data, it is penalized. This allows it to update it's weights and get better at classifying real and fake data.

If the discriminator succeeds at classifying the fake data from the real data, the generator is penalized, and updates it weights accordingly to generate better results that closely mirror the real data.

This is a form of <b>adversarial training</b> where machine learning models compete against one another trying to outsmart the other.

Take for example a GAN that is trained on reviews for a restaurant, we can have a review (real data) as follows:

```"Excellent service and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the pasta."```

initially the generator would try to generate a sentence like

```"Delicious pasta, service recommend and food"```

which does not make much sense, and the discriminator would classify it as fake, as more epochs are executed, the generator will get better at tricking the discriminator into thinking the fake data is real, it would eventually produce a result as follows:

```"The service was impeccable and the cuisine, particularly the pasta, was delectable. I wholeheartedly endorse the pasta, itâ€™s a must-try!"```
